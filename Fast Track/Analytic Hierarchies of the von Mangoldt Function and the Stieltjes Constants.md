This is an **excellent, high-level outline** for an advanced graduate lecture series. The structure is logical, the concepts are highly relevant to analytic number theory, and the exercises are challenging and appropriate for the target audience. The "Commentary" sections are particularly helpful for providing context and intuition.

The issue you described with math display quitting after the first part is due to using inline $\LaTeX$ instead of display $\LaTeX$ for complex equations, and also needing to ensure all $\LaTeX$ is correctly delimited.

Here is the proofread and improved version, ensuring all mathematical expressions are correctly formatted and making minor stylistic and structural improvements for clarity and flow.

## 🎓 Lecture Series: Analytic Hierarchies of the von Mangoldt Function and the Stieltjes Constants

**Level:** Advanced Graduate (Analytic Number Theory)
**Prerequisites:**

  * Familiarity with Dirichlet series and Euler products
  * Basic complex analysis (residues, contour shifts)
  * Understanding of Mellin transforms
  * Elementary knowledge of prime number theory

-----

## 📘 Lecture 1 — The von Mangoldt Function and Its Generating Series

### 1.1 The von Mangoldt Function

The **von Mangoldt function**, $\Lambda(n)$, is defined as:

$$
\Lambda(n) =
\begin{cases}
\log p, & \text{if } n=p^k \text{ for a prime } p \text{ and integer } k\ge1,\\
0, & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
$$This function “weights” integers by their prime power structure and lies at the core of analytic number theory.

### 1.2 Dirichlet Generating Function

For the region of convergence, $\Re(s)>1$, its Dirichlet series is:

$$\\sum\_{n\\ge1}\\frac{\\Lambda(n)}{n^{s}} = -\\frac{\\zeta'(s)}{\\zeta(s)}.
$$  \* The left-hand side **encodes information about the primes**.

  * The right-hand side is the **logarithmic derivative of the Riemann zeta function** $\zeta(s)$.
  * Zeros of $\zeta(s)$ correspond to **oscillations in prime density**.

### 💬 Commentary

This equality acts as an essential **“dictionary”** between arithmetic objects (primes) and analytic structure (the zeta function). Whenever we differentiate $-\zeta'/\zeta$, we generate higher **“moments”** of the von Mangoldt distribution, which leads to the hierarchies in the next lecture.

### 🧠 Exercises

1.  Show directly from the Euler product $\zeta(s)=\prod_p(1-p^{-s})^{-1}$ that
    $$
    $$$$-\\frac{\\zeta'(s)}{\\zeta(s)}=\\sum\_p \\frac{\\log p}{p^s-1}.
    $$
    $$$$Expand this series to recover $\sum_{n\ge1} \Lambda(n)/n^s$.
2.  Use the logarithmic derivative to show that the simple pole at $s=1$ in $\zeta(s)$ implies that **primes dominate the behavior of $\zeta(s)$ near $s=1$**.
3.  The Chebyshev function is $\Psi(x)=\sum_{n\le x}\Lambda(n)$. Prove that $\Psi(x)$ has the same asymptotic order as $x$, i.e., $\Psi(x)\sim x$.

## 📘 Lecture 2 — The von Mangoldt Hierarchies

### 2.1 Definition

We define the $\boldsymbol{k}^{\text{th}}$ von Mangoldt function $\Lambda_k(n)$ via its Dirichlet series for an integer $k\ge0$:

$$
\boxed{
\sum_{n\ge1}\frac{\Lambda_k(n)}{n^{s}}
= (-1)^k\frac{d^k}{ds^k}\!\left[-\frac{\zeta'(s)}{\zeta(s)}\right]
}, \quad \Re(s)>1.
$$  * $k=0$: This recovers the original $\Lambda_0(n)=\Lambda(n)$.
* $k=1$: $\Lambda_1(n)$ is related to a logarithmic derivative of the prime distribution.
* $k\ge2$: These functions can be viewed as **“higher cumulants”** of the prime distribution.

### 2.2 Partial Sums

We denote the partial sums as $\Psi_k(x)=\sum_{n\le x}\Lambda_k(n)$. Each $\Psi_k(x)$ captures a deeper layer of arithmetic structure—akin to higher-order derivatives in probability generating functions.

### 💬 Commentary

Think of $-\zeta'/\zeta$ as a moment generating function for the primes (weighted by $\log n$). Each derivative $d^k/ds^k$ corresponds to observing **higher-order fluctuations** or **skewness** in the distribution of primes.

### 🧠 Exercises

1.  Compute the first two functions explicitly and verify their relationship:
$$

```
$$\\Lambda\_0(n)=\\Lambda(n), \\qquad
\\Lambda\_1(n)= (\\log n)\\Lambda(n).
$$
$$*Note: The derivative of $n^{-s}$ with respect to $s$ is $-\log(n)n^{-s}$.*
```

2.  Write a short Python/MATLAB script to tabulate $\Lambda_k(n)$ for small $n$ (say, $n\le 10$).
3.  Interpret $\Lambda_k(n)$ probabilistically: if $\Lambda(n)$ represents the presence of a prime power, what do the higher derivatives $\Lambda_k(n)$ measure?

## 📘 Lecture 3 — Mellin Transforms and Explicit Formulas

### 3.1 Mellin Transform of the Hierarchy

Using the integral representation of the Dirichlet series, we obtain:

$$
\int_0^\infty \Psi_k(x)x^{-s-1}\,dx
=\frac{1}{s}\sum_{n\ge1}\frac{\Lambda_k(n)}{n^s}
=\boxed{\frac{(-1)^k}{s}\frac{d^k}{ds^k}\!\left[-\frac{\zeta'(s)}{\zeta(s)}\right]}.
$$### 3.2 Mellin Inversion

The partial sum function $\Psi_k(x)$ is recovered by the Mellin inversion formula:

$$\\Psi\_k(x)
\=\\frac{1}{2\\pi i}\\int\_{c-i\\infty}^{c+i\\infty}
\\frac{(-1)^k}{s}\\frac{d^k}{ds^k}\!\\left[-\\frac{\\zeta'(s)}{\\zeta(s)}\\right]
x^s,ds,\\quad c\>1.
$$\#\#\# 💬 Commentary

This contour integral is the **exact analytic representation** of $\Psi_k(x)$. Shifting the contour leftward (past poles and zeros of $\zeta$) is the key step that reveals the structure:

  * A **main term** from the simple pole at $s=1$.
  * **Oscillatory terms** from the non-trivial zeros $\rho$.

This process demonstrates how the analytic continuation of $\zeta(s)$ directly creates the prime oscillations observed in explicit formulas.

### 🧠 Exercises

1.  Verify the Mellin transform identity by partial summation for $k=0$.
2.  Perform a contour shift for $\Psi_k(x)$ and find the residue at $s=1$. Express the residue in terms of derivatives of the logarithmic derivative of $\zeta(s)$ evaluated at $s=1$.
3.  Show how the non-trivial zeros $\rho$ contribute $x^{\rho}$ terms to the error term for $\Psi_k(x)$.
4.  Compute the main term for $\Psi_1(x)$ using the first few Stieltjes constants (which are introduced in Lecture 4).

## 📘 Lecture 4 — The Stieltjes Constants and Their Generating Function

### 4.1 Definition

The **Stieltjes constants**, $\gamma_n$, are coefficients in the Laurent expansion of $\zeta(s)$ near the pole at $s=1$:

$$
\zeta(1+u)=\frac{1}{u}+\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{(-1)^n\gamma_n}{n!}u^n.
$$They generalize **Euler’s constant** ($\gamma_0 \approx 0.5772$, with $\gamma_0 = -\psi(1)$ where $\psi$ is the digamma function) and encode $\zeta(s)$'s local behavior at $s=1$.

### 4.2 Exponential Generating Function (EGF)

A more compact expression exists for the Stieltjes constants:

$$\\boxed{G(t)=\\sum\_{n=0}^\\infty\\frac{\\gamma\_n}{n\!}t^n
\=\\zeta(1-t)+\\frac{1}{t}}.
$$\#\#\# 💬 Commentary

This elegant identity reveals:

  * $G(t)$ is an **entire function** (the singularities cancel at $t=0$).
  * The singularities of $G(t)$ in the complex plane correspond precisely to the **zeros of $\zeta(1-t)$**, which are the non-trivial zeros $\rho$ of $\zeta(s)$.
  * Therefore, the growth and sign changes of the sequence $\{\gamma_n\}$ directly reflect the **distribution of the non-trivial zeros**.

### 🧠 Exercises

1.  Verify the EGF identity by substituting $u=-t$ in the Laurent expansion of $\zeta(1+u)$.
2.  Determine the radius of convergence of $G(t)$ by finding the zero of $\zeta(s)$ nearest to $s=1$.
3.  Compute $\gamma_0, \gamma_1, \gamma_2$ numerically (or look up their values) and observe their alternating signs for small $n$.

## 📘 Lecture 5 — Relating Stieltjes Constants to Prime Fluctuations

### 5.1 Expansion of the Generating Function

The local expansion of the generating function for the von Mangoldt hierarchy at $s=1$ is:

$$
-\frac{\zeta'(s)}{\zeta(s)}
=\frac{1}{s-1}-\sum_{n=0}^\infty \eta_n (s-1)^n,
$$where the coefficients $\eta_n$ are polynomially expressible in the Stieltjes constants $\gamma_m$.

### 5.2 Connecting Local and Global

The $k$-th von Mangoldt hierarchy function is related to the local behavior of its generating function:

$$\\Lambda\_k(n)\\leftrightarrow
\\left.\\frac{d^k}{ds^k}\!\\left(-\\frac{\\zeta’(s)}{\\zeta(s)}\\right)\\right|\_{s=1}
\\propto \\eta\_k.
$$\#\#\# 💬 Commentary

The **Stieltjes constants $\gamma_n$ encode local cumulant-like data at $s=1$**, while the **$\Lambda_k(n)$ describe global fluctuations of primes**. Their relationship via the Mellin transform and the local Taylor expansion at $s=1$ provides a crucial bridge between **local analytic data** and **global arithmetic behavior**. The non-trivial zeros act as the medium of this translation.

### 🧠 Exercises

1.  Derive the expressions for $\eta_n$ in terms of $\gamma_n$ for $n=0, 1, 2$. (*Hint: Use the relations $\zeta'(s)/\zeta(s) = \frac{d}{ds} \log \zeta(s)$ and the Laurent expansion.*)
2.  Write explicit formulas for $\Psi_k(x)$ up to $k=2$ using the residues of the Mellin inversion, showing the main term and the sum over zeros.
3.  Show how each non-trivial zero $\rho$ contributes a term of the form $x^{\rho} P_k(\rho,\log x)$ to the error term of $\Psi_k(x)$, where $P_k$ is a polynomial in $\log x$.

## 📘 Lecture 6 — Further Insights on the Stieltjes Constants

### 6.1 Multiple Useful Viewpoints

| Viewpoint | Core Idea | Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cumulant/Probabilistic** | View $\gamma_n$ as cumulant-like coefficients of the local measure at $s=1$ via $G(t)=\zeta(1-t)+1/t$. | Sign oscillations are framed as **higher-order cumulant noise**, suggesting probabilistic smoothing (e.g., Bell-polynomial transforms) to find dominant scales. |
| **Spectral/Entire-Function** | Treat $G(t)$ as an entire function whose singularities are at $t=1-\rho$. | Patterns in $\{\gamma_n\}$ reflect the **zero spectrum**. Zeros close to $s=1$ produce the strongest contributions to large-$n$ behavior. |
| **Asymptotic/Saddle-Point** | Large-$n$ growth is governed by a saddle-point analysis of the EGF $G(t)$. | Predicts **super-exponential growth** ($\sim n!$) modulated by oscillatory factors coming from nearby singularities. |

### 6.2 Exact Classical Representation

The Stieltjes constants can be computed via a limit formula, often a convenient starting point for derivations:

$$
\gamma_n \;=\; \lim_{m\to\infty}\left(\sum_{k=1}^m\frac{(\log k)^n}{k} \;-\; \frac{(\log m)^{n+1}}{n+1}\right).
$$### 🧠 Exercises (Extra)

1.  Use the limit formula to compute $\gamma_0, \gamma_1, \gamma_2$ with numerical software and compare with values obtained from contour-integral results.
2.  Implement a small experiment: plot the scaled values $\gamma_n/n!$ for $n$ up to 50 at increasing precision and observe the envelope and sign changes.
3.  Apply a Bell-polynomial transform (or simple exponential smoothing) to the first 20 $\gamma_n$ and comment on any improvement in sign-regularity.

## 📘 Lecture 7 — Open Problems and Research Directions

| Theme | Research Question | Comment |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Analytic** | Prove uniform asymptotics for $\Psi_k(x)$ in $k$. | Zeta derivatives grow fast and complicate convergence near the critical line. |
| **Probabilistic** | Construct a random model with cumulants equal to $\gamma_n$. | A successful model could explain the sign patterns and the observed **“prime noise.”** |
| **Positivity** | Can a simple transformation of $\gamma_n$ yield an all-positive sequence? | An affirmative answer might be possible via Bell or exponential smoothing/Borel transforms. |
| **Spectral** | Rigorously interpret $G(t)=\zeta(1-t)+1/t$ as a spectral generating function. | Suggests a formal **“Stieltjes spectrum”** tied to the zeros. |
| **Computational** | Develop efficient and stable computation of $\Psi_k(x)$ for large $k$. | Requires stable evaluation of $\zeta(s)$ derivatives near the critical line. |
