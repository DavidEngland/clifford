### The Great Physics Race

Lagrange, a river of motion and might, 🌊
Subtracts from the path in the fading light.
He flows through the valleys, a single bold trail,
With the shortest of actions, he’s destined to prevail.

***
From distant shores, old Euler takes note,
His eyes on the current, a ship set afloat.
He watches the change in the particle's speed,
A point-to-point journey, a vector's good deed.
***
And over in Ireland, with a bit of a flair, 🍀
Hamilton's adding, without a care.
He sums up the energy, potential and kinetic,
A total that's constant, forever symmetric.
***
So picture a team, a dynamic display,
Of physicists working, throughout the whole day.
**Lagrange** finds the path that's the easiest to take,
**Euler** observes every motion they make.
And **Hamilton** adds up the total, you see,
A universal constant for you and for me.
