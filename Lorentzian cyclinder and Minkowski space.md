The Lorentzian cyclinder and Minkowski space are not globally conformally equivalent.  Nevertheless, the two manifolds share the same maximal conformal symmetry group.

## Note on conformal (non-)equivalence and symmetry in 1+1 dimensions

Claim 1 (non–equivalence).
The 2D Einstein cylinder \((\mathbb{R}\times \mathbb{S}^1,\, -dt^2+d\theta^2)\) and 2D Minkowski space \((\mathbb{R}^{1,1},\, -dT^2+dX^2)\) are not globally conformally equivalent.

Proof (short). Any conformal equivalence is, in particular, a diffeomorphism. But
\[
\pi_1(\mathbb{R}^{1,1})=0,\qquad \pi_1(\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{S}^1)\cong\mathbb{Z}.
\]
Since fundamental groups are diffeomorphism invariants, no global conformal diffeomorphism exists. (Equivalently: Minkowski admits a global Penrose compactification into a proper subset (a “diamond”) of the Einstein cylinder; it does not cover the whole cylinder.)

Claim 2 (local conformal structure).
In null coordinates, \(u=t+\theta,\ v=t-\theta\) on the cylinder and \(u=T+X,\ v=T-X\) on Minkowski, any local conformal diffeomorphism is of the form
\[
(u,v)\mapsto\big(\phi(u),\,\psi(v)\big)
\]
with \(\phi,\psi\) smooth, strictly monotone. Thus the local conformal Lie algebra is generated by vector fields
\[
X=\xi(u)\,\partial_u+\eta(v)\,\partial_v,
\]
yielding (formally) \(\mathrm{Diff}(\text{null line})\times\mathrm{Diff}(\text{null line})\).

Global groups (two standard choices):
- Infinite–dimensional (“maximal” local) group: on \(\mathbb{R}^{1,1}\), \(\mathrm{Diff}(\mathbb{R})\times \mathrm{Diff}(\mathbb{R})\); on \(\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{S}^1\), \(\mathrm{Diff}(\mathbb{S}^1)\times \mathrm{Diff}(\mathbb{S}^1)\).
- Finite–dimensional (“global” conformal group that extends to the Penrose compactification): both spaces share
\[
\mathrm{SO}(2,2)\ \simeq\ \frac{\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})\times \mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})}{\{\pm(I,I)\}},
\]
with Lie algebra \(\mathfrak{so}(2,2)\cong \mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{R})\oplus\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{R})\), generated by \(\{1,u,u^2\}\) in each null sector (on \(\mathbb{R}\)) or the corresponding trigonometric basis on \(\mathbb{S}^1\).

Conclusion.
- Not globally conformally equivalent (topological obstruction).
- Locally the conformal structure is the same (independent reparametrizations of null coordinates).
- If “maximal conformal symmetry group” means the finite global group preserving the compactification, both have the same group \(\mathrm{SO}(2,2)\); if it means the full group of global conformal diffeomorphisms, one gets \(\mathrm{Diff}(\mathbb{R})^2\) versus \(\mathrm{Diff}(\mathbb{S}^1)^2\).

## Added Clarifications and Critique

1. Terminology (maximal group): The phrase “same maximal conformal symmetry group” is ambiguous. In 2D one usually distinguishes:
   - Local conformal transformations: independent reparametrizations of null coordinates → Diff(ℝ)×Diff(ℝ) (plane) or Diff(S¹)×Diff(S¹) (cylinder).
   - Global (finite) conformal group preserving the causal compactification: (PSL(2,ℝ)×PSL(2,ℝ))/ℤ₂ ≅ SO⁺(2,2). Stating SO(2,2) without specifying connected component may hide time/orientation issues.

2. Periodicity constraints: On the Einstein cylinder with coordinates (t,θ) ∈ ℝ×S¹, null coordinates u=t+θ, v=t−θ satisfy (u,v) ∼ (u+2π, v+2π). A global conformal diffeomorphism (φ(u), ψ(v)) must respect this identification, forcing φ(u+2π)=φ(u)+2π and similarly for ψ, hence φ,ψ induce circle diffeomorphisms. Making this explicit prevents confusion between merely local forms and globally well-defined maps.

3. Penrose compactification remark: Minkowski 1+1 embeds conformally into an open diamond of the cylinder; the obstruction is topological (π₁) and global causal extension (incompleteness of null infinities in the image). Your argument via fundamental group is correct and minimal; you might add that any global conformal diffeomorphism would induce an isomorphism of universal covers, conflicting with compact spatial factor.

4. Vector-field basis: The “{1,u,u²}” basis generating sl(2,ℝ) in each null sector is standard for ℝ. On S¹ one often uses the trigonometric realization {1, sinσ, cosσ} (after appropriate linear combinations) or Möbius generators expressed via complex coordinate z=e^{iσ}. Clarifying this prevents students from assuming polynomial generators exist globally on the circle.

5. Virasoro extension (optional context): In 2D conformal field theory the physically relevant symmetry is the central extension (Virasoro) of the Witt algebra (the algebra of vector fields on S¹). Your current text treats only the classical (non-extended) case; a one-sentence note could highlight this distinction for readers aiming at CFT.

6. Orientation/time orientation: Full Diff(ℝ)×Diff(ℝ) includes transformations reversing orientation. Often one restricts to orientation-preserving (and time-orientation preserving) components. Specify which component if physical causality is assumed.

7. Notation consistency: Mixing “Einstein cylinder” and “Lorentzian cyclinder” (typo) may distract; standard spelling “cylinder” should be uniform. Likewise, write ℝ^{1,1} with metric −dT² + dX² and (ℝ×S¹, −dt² + dθ²) consistently.

8. Conformal factor: You present transformations in null variables but do not show explicit conformal rescaling of the metric: g → Ω² g with Ω² = φ'(u) ψ'(v)/4 (up to chosen normalization). Adding this line makes the conformal nature transparent.

### Suggested Insert (Compact Version)

Add after “Claim 2”:

> Global constraint: On the cylinder (u,v)∼(u+2π,v+2π); thus a globally defined conformal map (u,v)↦(φ(u),ψ(v)) requires φ(u+2π)=φ(u)+2π, ψ(v+2π)=ψ(v)+2π, inducing elements of Diff(S¹) in each sector. The metric transforms as
> 
> \[
> -dt^{2}+d\theta^{2}= -\,du\,dv \;\longmapsto\; -\,\phi'(u)\,\psi'(v)\,du\,dv = \Omega^{2}(u,v)\,(-du\,dv),\quad \Omega^{2}=\phi'(u)\psi'(v).
> \]
> 
> Hence the local form is universal, while global admissibility depends on periodicity.

### Minimal Revision (integrated changes)

The Lorentzian cyclinder and Minkowski space are not globally conformally equivalent.  Nevertheless, the two manifolds share the same maximal conformal symmetry group.

## Note on conformal (non-)equivalence and symmetry in 1+1 dimensions

Claim 1 (non–equivalence).
The 2D Einstein cylinder \((\mathbb{R}\times \mathbb{S}^1,\, -dt^2+d\theta^2)\) and 2D Minkowski space \((\mathbb{R}^{1,1},\, -dT^2+dX^2)\) are not globally conformally equivalent.

Proof (short). Any conformal equivalence is, in particular, a diffeomorphism. But
\[
\pi_1(\mathbb{R}^{1,1})=0,\qquad \pi_1(\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{S}^1)\cong\mathbb{Z}.
\]
Since fundamental groups are diffeomorphism invariants, no global conformal diffeomorphism exists. (Equivalently: Minkowski admits a global Penrose compactification into a proper subset (a “diamond”) of the Einstein cylinder; it does not cover the whole cylinder.)

Claim 2 (local conformal structure).
In null coordinates, \(u=t+\theta,\ v=t-\theta\) on the cylinder and \(u=T+X,\ v=T-X\) on Minkowski, any local conformal diffeomorphism is of the form
\[
(u,v)\mapsto\big(\phi(u),\,\psi(v)\big)
\]
with \(\phi,\psi\) smooth, strictly monotone. Thus the local conformal Lie algebra is generated by vector fields
\[
X=\xi(u)\,\partial_u+\eta(v)\,\partial_v,
\]
yielding (formally) \(\mathrm{Diff}(\text{null line})\times\mathrm{Diff}(\text{null line})\).

Global groups (two standard choices):
- Infinite–dimensional (“maximal” local) group: on \(\mathbb{R}^{1,1}\), \(\mathrm{Diff}(\mathbb{R})\times \mathrm{Diff}(\mathbb{R})\); on \(\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{S}^1\), \(\mathrm{Diff}(\mathbb{S}^1)\times \mathrm{Diff}(\mathbb{S}^1)\).
- Finite–dimensional (“global” conformal group that extends to the Penrose compactification): both spaces share
\[
\mathrm{SO}(2,2)\ \simeq\ \frac{\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})\times \mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})}{\{\pm(I,I)\}},
\]
with Lie algebra \(\mathfrak{so}(2,2)\cong \mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{R})\oplus\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{R})\), generated by \(\{1,u,u^2\}\) in each null sector (on \(\mathbb{R}\)) or the corresponding trigonometric basis on \(\mathbb{S}^1\).

Conclusion.
- Not globally conformally equivalent (topological obstruction).
- Locally the conformal structure is the same (independent reparametrizations of null coordinates).
- If “maximal conformal symmetry group” means the finite global group preserving the compactification, both have the same group \(\mathrm{SO}(2,2)\); if it means the full group of global conformal diffeomorphisms, one gets \(\mathrm{Diff}(\mathbb{R})^2\) versus \(\mathrm{Diff}(\mathbb{S}^1)^2\).

## Optional Additional Note (CFT context)
For 2D quantum conformal field theory one replaces the finite-dimensional global conformal algebra sl(2,ℝ)⊕sl(2,ℝ) by two copies of the Virasoro algebra (central extension of the Witt algebra of vector fields on S¹). This does not alter the classical global non-equivalence between Minkowski space and the Einstein cylinder but enriches representation theory on the cylinder.

Summary of critique: Logical core correct (π₁ obstruction, local factorization). Improve precision on “maximal group” meaning, periodicity/global constraints, conformal factor display, and notation consistency; optionally mention Virasoro for advanced readers.
