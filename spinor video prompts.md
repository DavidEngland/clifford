I cannot create a video for you, but I can provide some search results that might help you find a suitable video or give you ideas for creating your own.

Here are some concepts you can use as prompts to create a visual aid:
* A long, clear, flexible tube.
* A small ball or object that fits inside the tube.
* The tube is twisted to form a figure-eight shape, with the crossover point held by your hand or covered.
* The ball appears to travel through the crossover point, demonstrating a 360-degree rotation.
* The trick is then "undone," and the ball is revealed to be on the other side of the tube.

## Options for Demonstration

### 1. In-Class Demo
- Use a long, clear, flexible tube and a small ball or object that fits inside.
- Twist the tube into a figure-eight shape, holding or covering the crossover point.
- Move the ball through the crossover, showing a 360-degree rotation.
- "Undo" the trick to reveal the ball on the other side, illustrating the concept visually.

### 2. AI-Generated Video
- Create an animation showing a tube twisted into a figure-eight, with a ball moving through it.
- Highlight the rotation and crossover point to demonstrate the spinor concept.
- Use captions or voiceover to explain each step.
- Tools like Blender, After Effects, or online AI video generators can help create this visual aid.
